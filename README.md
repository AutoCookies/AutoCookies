## 🚀 About Me  

Hi! I'm **AutoCookies**,  
🎓 A student who loves building, breaking, and re-creating things.  
🌱 Always curious about how stuff works under the hood.  
💡 My motto: **_"Be a creator, not a person just know to use existing solutions."_**

Although I'm still early in my career, I believe **creativity > experience**.  
Every repo here is a piece of my journey — some are projects, some are experiments, some are just for fun!
