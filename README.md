## 🚀 About Me  

Hi! I'm **AutoCookies**,  
🎓 A student who loves building, breaking, and re-creating things.  
🌱 Always curious about how stuff works under the hood.  
💡 My motto: **_"Be a creator, not a person just know to use existing solutions."_**

Although I'm still early in my career, I believe **creativity > experience**.  
Every repo here is a piece of my journey — some are projects, some are experiments, some are just for fun!

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here  

🔹 **Study Projects** – assignments, learning exercises, and explorations.  
🔹 **Fun Experiments** – random ideas turned into code.  
🔹 **Open-source Love** – small contributions & attempts to give back.

## 🎯 Vision  

> "I don’t just want to **use** solutions.  
> I want to **create** them."  

💻 I dream of turning ideas into real products.  
✨ One repo at a time, I'm shaping my skills.
